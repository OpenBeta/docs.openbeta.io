Welcome to OpenTacos! 🥳🥳🥳

If you're here we assume you've already [visited the site](https://openbeta.io) and had a chance to click around, and are here to get help on using one of the tools bundled in OpenTacos

## What is OpenTacos

[OpenTacos](https://github.com/openbeta/opentacos) is our mystically-named website that provides users with a way to work with the climbing dataset in their day to day climbing adventures.

While the history of the name may be a little hazy, the purpose of the site is clearly defined. A platform and tool-set that reduces friction as much as possible for users who are minded to help maintain the OpenBeta climbing data.

### Home Page

![Homepage](/img/tutorial/opentacos/homepage.png)

The [home page](https://openbeta.io) of OpenTacos is a dynamic place, and will be changing constantly over the next few development cycles (If you want to be a part of shaping it, visit our [github](https://github.com/OpenBeta)).

Don't let this scare you! The home page will always put you a few clicks from maps, recent posts, and recent edit history.

### Climb Page

The climb page documents all-things climbing. This is where you can see all images tagged with a climb, as well as all recorded beta.

#### Ticks

Ticks allow users to log and track the climbs that they have completed. Ticks serve a number of practical purposes ([See more about ticks here](/how-to-contribute/contributing-data/user-related#ticks))

##### How to import ticks from [Mountain Project](https://mountainproject.com)

### Crag / Boulder Page

### Area Page

![area page](/img/tutorial/opentacos/area-page.png)

The area page allows you to browse the climb/crag heirarchy and see where data has been sorted. Areas also collate media from their children, which can be useful while navigating or sizing up a crag or boulder.

### [Profile](/how-to-contribute/using-opentacos/profile-and-photos)

If you are logged in to OpenTacos, you will see a profile button in the top right. This is where you will manage things related to your profile ([click here to see more about the profile page](/how-to-contribute/using-opentacos/profile-and-photos))

### Create an Account

In order to make data contributions to OpenBeta, users are required to be authenticated. All you need is an email address, and you can get going! 📭

Go to the [home page](https://openbeta.io) and click the **become a contributor** button in the top right corner.

### Maps

Maps are a critical and currently growing part of the OpenBeta service offering. Whether you're navigating or simple exploring an area, maps are an invaluable part of the process.

OpenBeta makes use of a heatmap to express climb density, with hotspots representing areas that have a high density of climbs (as can be seen in the below image)

## How can I contribute to OpenTacos

"Contributors" on OpenTacos are the people who help to maintain and grow the OpenBeta dataset. To join this effort all you need is [an account](#create-an-account)

There are a number of ways you can join the effort, some of them are listed below.

### Become a Contributor

Even if all you do is upload some photos and correct some spelling, being a contributor on OpenTacos will improve the dataset for future climbers.

### Join the Team

If you want, you can go beyond working with the tools provided by OpenTacos. This could be to **work on the tools themselves** or to assist the developers that are.

The OpenBeta team usually communicate on [discord](https://discord.gg/RFufzsqRmJ) and catalogue issues with [GitHub](https://github.com/openbeta/opentaco)

#### Become a Developer

Follow the [onboarding process](/how-to-contribute/onboarding-checklist) and start contributing code to the OpenTacos project! 🖥

#### Contribute in other parts of development

If you are not a developer - but still want to assist with development - fear not! You could [become a sponsor](/support-us), but you needn't stop there. Our developers often need help finding and reporting bugs, you can report bugs either as an [issue on the repository](https://github.com/openbeta/opentacos/issues) or by reporting it in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/RFufzsqRmJ).

We look forward to working with you!
